# Server overview

In version 0.2, PawCon targets to implement a server application with Node.js/Express, serving API and login authentication(JWT, Google Oauth, and Mongo DB).

Now, this is no longer a case. The project will now on target to _minimize_ server codes, adopting docker for API and decentralized id for login authentication.
