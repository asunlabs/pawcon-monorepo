## Managing learning curve

There are very wide ranges of blockchain technologies to learn: Fungible token, Non-fungible token, Ethereum, Binance, Smart contract,
EVM, storage, memory, slot, in-line assembly, audit, DeFi, Oracle, protocols, web3, nodes ... you name it. And these are changing very rapidly.

To catch up a super-fast changing industry, we need a well-defined strategy as to what to learn, how to learn.

Below I provide a Github repository link where I manage the learning curve in my own way.

- [@asunlabs/courses](https://github.com/asunlabs/courses)

This contains a list of directories where it proivdes various types of blockchain learning materials as well as other sections of software engineering.

Kudos to all levels of software engineers :)

## Project management

Project is managed with github project template, which can be checked [here](https://github.com/orgs/asunlabs/projects/3)

- kanban board
- product backlogs
- sprint
- roadmap

This is my effort to make github _a single source of truth_ of project, avoiding project fragmentation.

## Test driven development

I personally believe TDD is a great way to develop a software, especially in terms of smart contract development. The finest merit of TDD is that you can confidently confirm and make decisions about a feature being developed.

**When all the related test cases passed, the feature development is done.**

Of course, TDD is not a silver bullet tho and sometimes it might take some more time for its own setup and to get familiar with the concept. You gotta understand OOP, testing library, and Agile to take the most out of test driven development.
