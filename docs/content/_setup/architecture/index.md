## Heads-up

Below, readers will find a project architecture diagram, which differs per project version. I have tried to spell how the project evolves as time passes so that viewers can _feel_ the difference.

Timestamp per version will also be added.

Simple HTML, CSS, Javascript for a staic website without any server.

## Version 0.2.0
