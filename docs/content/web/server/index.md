In version 0.2, PawCon targets to implement a server application with Node.js/Express, serving API and login authentication(JWT, Google Oauth, and Mongo DB). Check [here](https://github.com/developerasun/pawcon/tree/main/server#pawcon-server) to find out what were implemented.

Now, this is no longer a case. The project will now on target to _minimize_ server codes, adopting docker for API and decentralized id for login authentication.

Logic behind minimizing backend code is about blockchain decentralization. _Finding out how much decentralized an app can be_ is one of the goals for the minimization. Consider this a technical experimentation, which is probable for _non-production_ application.
