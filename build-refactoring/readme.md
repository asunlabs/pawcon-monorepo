# Meow Canvas refactoring
This is a repository where I refactor all the codes written before and document what has been changed after refactoring. 

## List of changes
Meow Canvas is my first-ever web front end project and solo project, which inevitably caused a lot of trials and errors in and out projects. Below I have summarized what I had to get through in a table. 


<strong>In code-level</strong>
<ol>
  <li>More sematic HTML structure</li>
  <li>Responsive CSS in order : mobile -> tablet -> PC </li>
  <li>Object-oriented, modularized Javascript coding</li>
  <li>Writing modules, preventing one code file getting to big and fat</li>
</ol>

<strong>Out code-level</strong>
<ol>
  <li>Uploading minified codes</li>
  <li>More wireframes</li>
  <li>Handicrafed design asset : logo, icon, banner images</li>
  <li>Higher quality of design mockups</li>
  <li>Use of git branch</li>
  <li>Use of git pull request</li>
  <li>Getting teammates</li>
  <li>Getting enough contents(text, image) for website</li>
</ol>
