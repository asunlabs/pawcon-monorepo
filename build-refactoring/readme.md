# Meow Canvas refactoring
This is a repository where I refactor all the codes written before and document what has been changed after refactoring.

  <li>More test codes : Mocha</li>
  <li>Git branch and semantic versioning for version control</li>

  <li>More functional features with open source library : Hashlip</li>
  </ol>

<strong>Out code-level</strong>
