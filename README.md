# What is Meow Canvas?  
[See Demo](https://meowcanvas.netlify.app/) <br/>
[See Business Proposal](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IHb0xbrq-HqN_qfFg0-nPBrZMRjabtDE4lY-neMKXoI/edit?usp=sharing)

Meow canvas is a web service project that is <b>dedicated to all the cat lovers in github.</b> It targets to provide a virtual playground for cat owners so that they can share and show off their lovely cats by exploiting technologies like <b>NFT, machine learning.</b>    
<br/>

Main service feature is like below
<ul>
    <li> Upload your cat photo and draw your cat as you wish(2D, 3D) </li>
    <li> Share the drawing on social </li>
    <li> Make the drawing NFT and save it to your wallet</li>
    <li> Purchase your NFT and sell it to others </li>
    <li> Compare image similiarity between your photo and drawing </li>
    <li> Find out your ranking and increase it by resubmitting! </li>
</ul>
<br/>

The <b>expected</b> project schedule, which is very roughly estimated, is from early August of 2021 to at the end of 2022(one and half year).
<ol>
<li> Section 1 - (2021.10.01 ~ 2022.12.31, 3 month) : Web front end development, payment -> linking to backend database </li>
<li> Section 2 - (2022.01.01 ~ 2022.03.31, 3 month) : NFT smart contract, blockchain selection -> linking to the web </li>
<li> Section 3 - (2022.04.01 ~ 2022.07.31, 4 month) : Machine learning image similarity, database & cloud server selection -> linking to the web </li>
<li> Section 4 - (2022.08.01 ~ 2022.12.31, 5 month) : Web service launch and monetization -> maintenance </li>
