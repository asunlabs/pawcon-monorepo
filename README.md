# What is Meow Canvas?

<p>
Meow canvas is a NFT artwork generation service for those who are not familiar with digital art and graphic design. It targets to provide easy and fun ways to create NFT artwork without any technical/artistic background and then link the artworks with major NFT marketplaces such as Opensea and Rariable.

<p>
Once the beta is fairly developed with at least two main features, listed below, refactoring towards previously written codes will start. To make this project more efficient, cleaner, and more functional.

## Architecture
<p>
The architecture of this project is divided into two different sections. Pre-refactoring architecture is a learning phase, being familiar with web development basics.

The second phase is all about refactorting and improving project quality, applying frameworks and libraries that is actively used in modern web development environment.
