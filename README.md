# What is Meow Canvas?
### *This is a ongoing project that is actively being updated*
[See Beta](https://meowcanvas.netlify.app/) <br/>

<p>
Browser dominance research is needed to support cross browsing issues. The project works best in Chrome browser since the browser is development environment.

<p>
Meow canvas is a NFT artwork generation service for those who are not familiar with digital art and graphic design. It targets to provide easy and fun ways to create NFT artwork without any technical/artistic background and then link the artworks with major NFT marketplaces such as Opensea and Rariable.   
</p>

<p>
Once the beta is fairly developed with at least two main features, listed below, refactoring towards previously written codes will start. To make this project more efficient, cleaner, and more functional. 
</p>

<p>
The main feature of Meow Canvas, that will updated in future, is as follows. 
<ol>
    <li> Draw artwork with HTML/Javascript canvas - free/watermark </li>
    <li> Pixelate artwork with Javascfipt - free/watermark </li>
    <li> Generate artwork with Python GAN - paid </li>
    <li> Display your artwork and aim the highest rank - free</li>
    <li> Save and download the artwork to your wallet</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p> 
To acheive above, below sub-feature should be developed.
    <ol>
        <li>Login and sign up</li>
        <li>Shopping cart for membership</li>
        <li>Membership payment</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
Handicrafted design assets will be introduced in the refactored project for more clearer project identity. Currently, only banner images in image slider and logo is photoshopped and created by me. Design assets that will be added are such as : logo, icon, banner, brand colors, font.

simple slideToggle function in Javascript

``` Javascript:slideToggle.js
const trigger = document.querySelector("#trigger");
const navbar = document.querySelector(".navbar"); 
const menuText = document.createElement("span");

const TRIGGER_MENU = "MENU";
const TRIGGER_HIDE = "HIDE"; 
const CLASS_ACITVE = "active"; 
const CLASS_INACTIVE = "hidden"; 

function triggerOn(event) { 
    event.preventDefault();

    if (menuText.innerHTML  === TRIGGER_MENU) { 
        menuText.innerHTML = TRIGGER_HIDE;
        debugger;
        navbar.classList.add(CLASS_ACITVE); 

    } else { 
        menuText.innerHTML = TRIGGER_MENU;
        navbar.classList.remove(CLASS_ACITVE);
        debugger;
        navbar.classList.add(CLASS_INACTIVE);
    }
