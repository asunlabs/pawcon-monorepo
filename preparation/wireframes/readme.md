# Understanding wireframe
What is a wireframe? Wireframe is a visual representation that shows how an app or web screen is set. It can be hand-drawn and then digitized.  For example, UX designer thinks through how a login screen in app should be designed and start drawing a wireframe. 

Both app and web requires a wireframe to smoothly reflect what fundamental elements the app/web screen needs. Also, wireframe helps to understand better how your project is structured - from front end to back end. 

See below YouTube video and wireframe example for further details.

## Meow Canvas wireframes
<ol>
<li> App screen </li>
Below wireframes have been drawn with the help of [Diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) after watching above YouTube tutorial. Meow canvas is a visually focused service sine its main focus is showing and comparing cat drawings from users. Thus, in mobile main screen, sections are horizontally divided with canvas contents. In login screen, sub-sections for password recovery and Oauth are additionally placed at bottom.
